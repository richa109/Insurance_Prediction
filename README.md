This project predicts whether a customer is likely to purchase insurance based on a Kaggle dataset. It uses a Random Forest machine learning model to make accurate predictions by learning patterns from customer data. A Flask web interface is provided so that users can easily get instant predictions by entering data. This system demonstrates how machine learning can help businesses and individuals understand customer behavior and make informed decisions, making it easier for insurance companies to focus their efforts and save time by investing in users who are more likely to buy.
